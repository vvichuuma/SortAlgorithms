# SortAlgorithms
This is the Repo for Sort Algorithms. You can see the code for the various sort methods. The language is in javascript. 
#The Following are few hints that I wrote myself to remeber the sorts. 
BubbleSort - To Solve this you need to have 2 for Loops. 
InsertionSort - To Solve this you need a for Loop and a while Loop. 
SelectionSort - You are selecting an item from left to right and then swapping the one that is lesser than the selected element. For this you need to have 2 for loops. One is for general incrementation and the other is for the next element incrementation..
